# Hello! I'm Bruce :wave:

The article I would like to share is ["Grades Don't Matter"](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2021/03/13/grades-dont-matter.html) by Nicholas Yang.

This article is a part of the [Burn Rate](https://blog.torchnyu.com/) blog, a blog for NYU's Torch club which is centered around professional development and networking for computer science students. Full disclosure, I was never a part of the club and honestly don't know if they're still around, but I found this blog a few years ago and found some of the advice given by other NYU students to be pretty useful in how I thought about my education here.

This particular article helped me reframe my focus during my time at college. Despite what the title may say, the central thesis of the article is that perfect grades should not be the top priority during your college computer science education. In terms of graduate school and the workplace, few places demand far more than a "good" GPA, something hovering above a 3.5. This implies that prioritizing a 4.0 GPA over networking, research, or projects is perhaps foolhardy given your plans after undergrad. At the end of the day, Yang argues that your prioritization should come from an interest in computer science, and not from what your grades are.

> The problem I see with so many NYU students is that they focus too much on the grades and not on the learning.

And so the takeaway that stuck with me is that I should be spending more time fostering my interest in what I study and less time grinding away at homework assignments at 2 AM.

Anyway, if anybody wants to work on a project with me this semester, [hit me up](mailto:bxw201@nyu.edu)! :smile:

## Hi, I'm Brandon Chen

I agree with basically everything that was said in the article. I have heard from many others that your grades and school becomes trivial compared to other parts of your resume. Your interest and what you do with it goes further to prove your capabilities than a number. Grades in the long term don't matter but I liked the emphasis that not caring about grades isn't the same as getting bad grades. Good grades does help in getting your first experience/internship but your interest and what you do with your interest contributes the same if not more. Getting that 4.0 GPA looks nice but I would rather spend my efforts elsewhere, though I lost my chances at a 4.0 GPA years ago. Perhaps I don't need to fret over the test(s) I bombed in the past if they had no visible effect on my life right now. Finally, hit me up/add me on discord too cause I need friends :disappointed:.
