# Hello! I'm Bruce :wave:

The article I would like to share is ["Grades Don't Matter"](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2021/03/13/grades-dont-matter.html) by Nicholas Yang.

This article is a part of the [Burn Rate](https://blog.torchnyu.com/) blog, a blog for NYU's Torch club which is centered around professional development and networking for computer science students. Full disclosure, I was never a part of the club and honestly don't know if they're still around, but I found this blog a few years ago and found some of the advice given by other NYU students to be pretty useful in how I thought about my education here.

This particular article helped me reframe my focus during my time at college. Despite what the title may say, the central thesis of the article is that perfect grades should not be the top priority during your college computer science education. In terms of graduate school and the workplace, few places demand far more than a "good" GPA, something hovering above a 3.5. This implies that prioritizing a 4.0 GPA over networking, research, or projects is perhaps foolhardy given your plans after undergrad. At the end of the day, Yang argues that your prioritization should come from an interest in computer science, and not from what your grades are.

> The problem I see with so many NYU students is that they focus too much on the grades and not on the learning.

And so the takeaway that stuck with me is that I should be spending more time fostering my interest in what I study and less time grinding away at homework assignments at 2 AM.

Anyway, if anybody wants to work on a project with me this semester, [hit me up](mailto:bxw201@nyu.edu)! :smile:

JonasonWu (jw5911): The article is stating that grades do not really matter as long as you are passing the course and that you should focus on CS as an interest. However, grades may be an indicator of your interest in CS. If you are barely passing the CS courses, I believe that it will be harder to feel interested in CS and you will eventually end up learning CS just to get a passing grade. If you are getting good grades for CS, then you will likely be more enthusiastic about learning CS material to maintain the good grade. Thus, grades and interest may act as a sort of positive feedback loop or a negative feedback loop.
