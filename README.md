# Hello! I'm Bruce :wave:

The article I would like to share is ["Grades Don't Matter"](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2021/03/13/grades-dont-matter.html) by Nicholas Yang.

This article is a part of the [Burn Rate](https://blog.torchnyu.com/) blog, a blog for NYU's Torch club which is centered around professional development and networking for computer science students. Full disclosure, I was never a part of the club and honestly don't know if they're still around, but I found this blog a few years ago and found some of the advice given by other NYU students to be pretty useful in how I thought about my education here.

This particular article helped me reframe my focus during my time at college. Despite what the title may say, the central thesis of the article is that perfect grades should not be the top priority during your college computer science education. In terms of graduate school and the workplace, few places demand far more than a "good" GPA, something hovering above a 3.5. This implies that prioritizing a 4.0 GPA over networking, research, or projects is perhaps foolhardy given your plans after undergrad. At the end of the day, Yang argues that your prioritization should come from an interest in computer science, and not from what your grades are.

> The problem I see with so many NYU students is that they focus too much on the grades and not on the learning.

And so the takeaway that stuck with me is that I should be spending more time fostering my interest in what I study and less time grinding away at homework assignments at 2 AM.

Anyway, if anybody wants to work on a project with me this semester, [hit me up](mailto:bxw201@nyu.edu)! :smile:

## Charlie Xiang's Add-On

This concept of "oh maybe I'll get a master's" is an attitude that a lot of people around me have, and almost always it has nothing to do with what they want to do, but rather is something they feel like they _have_ to do in order to find a job that will pay a livable wage. It's certainly important to take into account that CS jobs are perfectly sustainable with only a bachelor's, but it is something that I think may be quite rare in other fields. The point on GPA, however, I fully stand behind. I think as a new college graduate, jobs may be a little more focused on your GPA, as there is little else to judge you by. However after the obstacle of getting that first job, I think employers will disregard that GPA and focus instead on your past experiences. All the good grades in the world won't mean anything if you don't know what you're doing, after all.
